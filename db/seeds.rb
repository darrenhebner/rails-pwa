    "The story behind the viral photo of a teacher in Ghana showing students Windows on a blackboard",
    "NO PC, NO PROBLEM",
    "\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">There has been global applause for a teacher in Ghana who posted photos of himself drawing on a blackboard with multi-colored chalk, the features of a Microsoft Word processing window. The students in his class can also be seen drawing it into their notebooks.</span></p>\n<p>Social media exploded in admiration and wonder at his effort to explain how computers work&mdash;without computers.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Richard Appiah Akoto, 33, is the information and communication technology (ICT) teacher at Betenase M/A Junior High School in the town of Sekyedomase, about two and half hours drive north of Ghana&rsquo;s second city, Kumasi. The school has no computers even though since 2011, 14 and 15-year-olds are expected to write and pass a national exam (without which students cannot progress to high school) with ICT being one of the subjects.</span></p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1217879-1\"></div><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&ldquo;This is not my first time [of drawing] it. I have been doing it anytime I am in the classroom&hellip;I like posting pictures on Facebook so I just felt like [sharing it]. I didn&rsquo;t know it would get the attention of people like that&rdquo;, says Akoto, who has been a teacher at the school for six years.</span></p>\n<p>On Facebook, Akoto goes by the nickname &ldquo;Owura Kwadwo Hottish&rdquo; which was the name that went viral on both Facebook and Twitter. His photo was seen as both a bit of ironic fun about life in Africa but also as a source of inspiration particularly for Africans in the tech community like the Cameroonian tech entrepreneur Rebecca Enonchong, who tweets as @africatechie.</p>\n<div class=\"fb-post\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hottish.owura/posts/1948212815208114?hc_location=ufi\" data-width=\"500\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The photos gained prominence </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TikyaKwadwo/photos/a.1511402802235705.1073741829.1250802124962442/1944963432212971/?type=3&amp;theater\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">after a popular Ghanaian comedian (who is also a teacher)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> shared it with his 140,000 Facebook fans and later picked up by international websites and tech enthusiasts on the continent. After Enonchong tweeted about him she reached out to Microsoft on Twitter. This has culminated in a promise by Microsoft to &ldquo;equip [Akoto] with a device from one of our partners, and access to our MCE program &amp; free professional development resources on.&rdquo; Akoto, however adds that the school needs about 50 computers in order for his classes to really fulfill its promise.</span></p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Supporting teachers to enable digital transformation in education is at the core of what we do.

    "Bollywood has twisted Holi into a disturbing tale of sexual violence",
    "MAKE IT STOP",
    "\n<p>India&rsquo;s most famously colourful festival has a dark side.</p>\n<p>As the country gears up to celebrate Holi on March 02, stocking up on bags of coloured powders and preparing the traditional <em>gujia</em> sweet, women are still coming to terms with the sheer nastiness of the news that a New Delhi student had balloons <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bura-maano-un-holi-hai-lsr-girl-gets-semen-filled-balloons-flung-at-her/story-C4tx7tMDXlV58Ovl0ZVhgM.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filled with semen</a> thrown on her. While this incident is particularly appalling, it&rsquo;s a reminder of how the joyous occasion makes way for sexual harassment in the garb of uninhibited interactions among strangers. It is normal during the celebrations for complete strangers to douse passersby in water and colours.</p>\n<p>Of course, sexual harassment is cruelly commonplace across India outside of Holi, too. But many women can attest to being particularly targeted at this time. And, often, Bollywood has a lot to do with this.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1218921-1\"></div><p>Besides teaching generations of Indians that stalking is the best way to turn a &ldquo;no&rdquo; into a &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; movies with Holi songs have for decades featured suggestive lyrics that almost normalise sexual harassment, disguising it under bright colours and celebrations. These songs are often accompanied by titillating videos that focus on female stars being chased by their lovers and drenched in colours, despite their protests. Nevertheless, they make it to Holi party playlists every year and contribute to the culture that makes it especially uncomfortable to be a woman out in public at this time of the year.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s some of the biggest culprits:</p>\n<h2>Aaj na Chhodenge from Kati Patang (1970)</h2>\n<div class=\"inline-video\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\"><meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Aaj Na Chhodenge - Bollywood Holi Song - Rajesh Khanna &amp; Asha Parekh - Kati Patang\"><meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Watch the Holi special song 'Aaj Na Chhodenge' sung by Kishore Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar from the super hit Bollywood movie Kati Patang (1970) starring Rajesh Khanna and Asha Parekh.

    "Most millennials don&#8217;t save because their employers don&#8217;t let them",
    "MYTH BUSTING",
    "\n<p>Only a third of working millennials in the US are contributing to a retirement plan, according to a  <a href=\"https://www.nirsonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Millennials-Report-1.pdf\">new report</a> (pdf) from the National Institute of Retirement Security (NIRS).</p>\n<p>Without such savings, they face a difficult financial future in their 50s and 60s as few, if any, will be the beneficiaries of <a href=\"https://qz.com/679808/companies-with-defined-benefit-pension-plans/\">traditional pension plans</a>, which companies are phasing out. Payments from the government&rsquo;s Social Security program are likely to be delayed and reduced. In contrast, 51% of Generation Xers and baby boomers contribute to their own retirement plans.</p>\n<p>The poor participation of millennials in such plans isn&rsquo;t because they don&rsquo;t try to <a href=\"https://qz.com/1189328/millennials-believe-the-stereotypes-about-themselves-even-when-theyre-not-true/\">save</a> or invest. Many simply have jobs that don&rsquo;t offer retirement plans of any sort, or haven&rsquo;t worked long enough to qualify. Employers usually require new employees to stay with the organization for at least a year before allowing them into retirement plans. That should change, said Jennifer Brown, head of research at NIRS, because it&rsquo;s critical to save for retirement as early as possible to allow savings to compound.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1217392-1\"></div><p>&ldquo;If we fix some of these eligibility issues, we can raise the generation&rsquo;s participation rates,&rdquo; Brown said in an interview. &ldquo;When you see millennials move from job to job, they are usually moving to get better benefits.&rdquo; Individual employees under 50 years old can contribute up to $18,500 in tax-free earnings into company-sponsored 401K plans this year.</p>\n<p>Two-thirds of millennials do work for an employer that offers a retirement savings plan, but only 55% of that group are eligible to participate, NIRS found. Of that 55%, a whopping 94% do participate, the same as Generation Xers and boomers.  In 2014, more than half of millennials had spent a year or less with their current employers, according to NIRS.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"S1OYl8m_M\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_S1OYl8m_M.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p>Millennials are more likely to be employed part-time than workers of other generations, and part-time employees are less likely to qualify for job benefits.  Companies can require employees to work a certain number of days to qualify for a retirement plan, or offer different plans to different kinds of employees. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) allows employers to <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/retirement-plans-and-erisa-consumer\">limit benefits</a> to those who work at least 1,000 hours a year.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"Sk741UmdM\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_Sk741UmdM.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n",

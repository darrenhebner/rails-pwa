    "You probably won&#8217;t remember this, but the &#8220;forgetting curve&#8221; theory explains why learning is hard",
    "FORGET ME NOT",
    "\n<p>Learning has an evolutionary purpose: Among species, individuals that adapt to their environments will succeed. That&rsquo;s why your brain more easily retains important or surprising information: It takes very little effort to remember that the neighbor&rsquo;s dog likes to bite. Remembering the dog&rsquo;s name is harder. One ensures safety, the other is just a random fact.</p>\n<p>But today, the kinds of things humans want to learn are rarely focused on survival; we also use our adaptive, evolutionary memory to remember new languages, 11-step face-washing routines, obscure vocabulary words, and facts about Star Wars. The trick to doing so, once you&rsquo;ve decided to acquire a new skill or build up your knowledge in a particular area, lies in convincing your brain that the information matters. In other words, you have to overcome the &ldquo;forgetting curve.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Hermann Ebbinghaus&rsquo; memory experiments</h2>\n<p>The forgetting curve is a mathematical formula that describes the rate at which something is forgotten after it is initially learned. The idea is over 100 years old. It originates in the late 19th century, with German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, who was among the first scientists to perform experiments to understand how memory works.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1213768-1\"></div><p>Ebbinghaus performed his experiments on himself. He would first memorize lists of meaningless syllables, say these:</p>\n<pre>DIF, LAJ, LEQ, MUV, WYC, DAL, SEN, KEP, NUD</pre>\n<p>After that, he tested himself periodically, to see how many of the nonsense syllables he remembered at various points in time. Ebbinghaus <a href=\"https://oli.cmu.edu/jcourse/workbook/activity/page?context=df3e71f70a0001dc30bd511d2c273b98\">discovered</a> that his memory of them quickly decayed. This phenomenon of learning and promptly forgetting information will be familiar to anyone who has tried to cram the night before an exam.</p>\n<p>Another way of putting it is that the forgetting curve is initially very steep. On a chart, the amount of knowledge retained drops almost straight down. Ebbinghaus also found, though, that his memory eventually leveled off. So the next day, he might remember just a few items from the list&mdash;but he would remember those for many days afterward.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-1212262\" class=\"progressive-image inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium\"><picture style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; background-image: url(https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/forgetting-curve-annotated.png?w=50);\"><img src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/forgetting-curve-annotated.png?w=50\" class=\"progressive-image-thumbnail\"><img data-srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/forgetting-curve-annotated.png?w=320 320w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/forgetting-curve-annotated.png?w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/forgetting-curve-annotated.png?w=940 940w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/forgetting-curve-annotated.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/forgetting-curve-annotated.png?w=3200 3200w\" data-src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/forgetting-curve-annotated.png?w=1280\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px\" class=\"progressive-image-large\" alt=\"forgetting-curve-annotated\"></picture></figure><p>Yet if this steep drop-off always followed learning, it seems it would be extremely time consuming to remember any full list. But we know from experience that such forgetfulness doesn&rsquo;t always occur (Princess Leia&rsquo;s prison cell block number: AA-23).</p>\n<p>Ebbinghaus made a second discovery: The downward slope of the forgetting curve can be softened by repeating the learned information at particular intervals. This principle is the foundation of the learning method known as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://qz.com/1211561\">spaced repetition</a>,&rdquo; where material is learned then reviewed after increasingly large time gaps.</p>\n<p>The modern version of Ebbinghaus&rsquo; discovery is defined with <a href=\"https://www.psychestudy.com/cognitive/memory/ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve\">this equation</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1213768-2\"></div><pre>R = e^(-t/s)</pre>\n<p>In this formula, <em>R</em> is a measure of how readily you can recall something, <em>s</em> is the &ldquo;strength&rdquo; of your memory, <em>t</em> is the amount of time that has passed, and <em>e</em> is the magical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)\">Euler&rsquo;s number</a>. Repeating and reviewing information increases the strength of the memory, leading the downward slope of <em>R</em> to become more gradual.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-1212372\" class=\"progressive-image inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium\"><picture style=\"padding-bottom: 65.104166666667%; background-image: url(https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=50);\"><img src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=50\" class=\"progressive-image-thumbnail\"><img data-srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=320 320w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=940 940w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=3200 3200w\" data-src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=1152\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px\" class=\"progressive-image-large\" alt=\"spaced-repetition-chart\"></picture></figure><p>Overcoming the forgetting curve is about more than raw repetitions. There has to be space between the reviews. It doesn&rsquo;t work to just study a new fact 15 times in 1 hour and overcome the curve. If the fact is already at the front of the mind, no work is being done in recalling it again. But if information is repeated at intervals, the brain has to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=opCLDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CSome+%E2%80%98breakdown%E2%80%99+must+occur+for+us+to+strengthen+learning+when+we+revisit+the+material.+Without+a+little+forgetting,+you+get+no+benefit+from+further+study.+It+is+what+allows+learning+to+build,+like+an+exercised+muscle.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3tq83rqVGI&amp;sig=eAnmUmF44xSITCeJRwk-fQ8AFWg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8g-zgiMnZAhWBdt8KHfpcD8AQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CSome%20%E2%80%98breakdown%E2%80%99%20must%20occur%20for%20us%20to%20strengthen%20learning%20when%20we%20revisit%20the%20material.%20Without%20a%20little%20forgetting%2C%20you%20get%20no%20benefit%20from%20further%20study.%20It%20is%20what%20allows%20learning%20to%20build%2C%20like%20an%20exercised%20muscle.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false\">reconstruct that memory</a>, strengthening it like a muscle.</p>\n<p>Spaced repetition works on other animals, too. One <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC311375/\">study</a> trained bees to recognize sugar water from other, less exciting stimuli. The bees that were trained every 10 minutes learned much better than those trained every 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>An unhelpful but common metaphor is that of the brain-as-computer, or computer-as-brain. The two things are often presented as working the same way. A brain &ldquo;stores&rdquo; memories like files on a hard drive, and software uses &ldquo;neural networks&rdquo; to learn like the human mind does. But the reality of learning is different. The computer won&rsquo;t forget where the file is, and the neural network can only learn what it&rsquo;s told to.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1213768-3\"></div><p>The forgetting curve shows how brains are different. They can learn anything, which means they need to filter out the important from the trivial. Luckily, understanding how the curve works makes it easier to learn things that may not be necessary for survival, but are deeply rewarding. Like a new language, a musical instrument, or the name of Chewbacca&rsquo;s father (it&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Chewbacca/Legends\">Attichitcuk</a>).</p>\n<hr><p><strong>Read next: <a href=\"https://qz.com/1211561/how-to-learn-a-language-use-spaced-repetition/\">The scientific, efficient way to learn languages: &ldquo;spaced repetition&rdquo;</a></strong></p>\n",

    "\n<p>Before your trip abroad, you hit the flashcards hard. You memorized how to say essential words and phrases like &ldquo;hello,&rdquo; &ldquo;where is the bathroom,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a beer.&rdquo; But once you arrived, it&rsquo;s like your brain had never encountered the language at all. Words would not come.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s how you used the flashcards: Learning a language as an adult takes time and effort, but the go-to study methods that most diligent language-learners use are out of date by about hundred years.</p>\n<p>There is a moment in every modern language learner&rsquo;s studies when they discover spaced repetition systems (SRS) and think, &ldquo;I have been wasting a lot of time by not doing this.&rdquo; SRS is learning system that makes the nitty-gritty of studying hundreds of new pieces of information&mdash;say vocabulary words&mdash;more efficient. If you&rsquo;re learning a language, you should be using it.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1211561-1\"></div><p>Good news: Spaced repetition also uses flashcards! There are two things that set it apart from cramming Spanish vocabulary words for a couple weeks before going to Mexico, though. Those two things are right in the name: &ldquo;space&rdquo; and &ldquo;repetition.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>The forgetting curve</h2>\n<p>Fundamental to the theory of spaced repetition is the idea of the &ldquo;forgetting curve,&rdquo; an idea thought up by the German psychologist Herman Ebbinghaus in the late 19th century. Think of this as the evil twin of the learning curve. It describes the rate at which you forget something once you learn it, either for the first time or after reviewing. There is even a <a href=\"https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/5199/which-equation-is-ebbinghauss-forgetting-curve-and-what-do-the-constants-repres\">formula</a> for it.</p>\n<p>The forgetting curve slopes steeply downward after you first learn something. New material tends to not stay around for long. This points to why cramming is a bad way to learn. It might help you pass the exam, but you will soon forget everything you were tested on. Luckily, the curve can be softened by reviewing the information at particular intervals. That is to say, spaced repetition.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1211561-2\"></div><p>This chart uses a modern version of the formula to show how the curve eases after repetitions.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-1212372\" class=\"progressive-image inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium\"><picture style=\"padding-bottom: 65.104166666667%; background-image: url(https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=50);\"><img src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=50\" class=\"progressive-image-thumbnail\"><img data-srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=320 320w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=940 940w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=3200 3200w\" data-src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spaced-repetition-chart.png?w=1152\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px\" class=\"progressive-image-large\" alt=\"spaced-repetition-chart\"></picture></figure><p>Using spaced repetition might mean that you study a flashcard for a new vocabulary word and review it the next day. For each review, you will indicate how well you remembered that card, perhaps on a scale of 0 (completely forgot) to 5 (remembered perfectly). Then you will review that word again after a period of time, based on how good your memory of it was. If you completely forgot it, you might see it again the next day. If you remembered it perfectly, it might be a month before that card appears again. Studies have shown that, even in animals, spaced repetition <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782739/\">works better</a> than trying to learn large batches of information at once.</p>\n<h2>The rules</h2>\n<p>So you&rsquo;re convinced (I hope) that spaced repetition works. Here are the rules to follow to get the most out of it for learning a language.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1211561-3\"></div><ol><li>Use software to store and keep track of your cards</li>\n<li>Review your cards once every day</li>\n<li>Make your own cards, and make them your own</li>\n<li>Add context to your cards</li>\n</ol><p>Rules 1 and 2 are the basis of SRS. You might ask at this point why you shouldn&rsquo;t use something like Duolingo, a popular language-learning app that has spaced repetition built in to its curriculum. The answer lies in rules 3 and 4. They may seem optional, but as I&rsquo;ll explain, making your own cards and personalizing them will greatly increase your ability to remember new material and learn things that are important specifically to you.</p>\n<h2>1. Spaced repetition software</h2>\n<p>The spaced repetition algorithm is pretty simple, and there are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system\">ways</a> to use the system without the help of software. But using a computer or device is better for a few reasons. It makes it easy to create and edit cards, and to use other tools to add context to those cards. Most importantly, it makes it less tedious for you to get going with a review session.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular SRS programs, and the one I recommend, is <a href=\"https://apps.ankiweb.net/\">Anki</a>. It is open source (meaning it&rsquo;s free), extremely flexible, offers cloud syncing for your flashcards, and has solid mobile apps. There are certainly alternatives. One is <a href=\"https://tinycards.duolingo.com/\">Tinycards</a>, an SRS app made by Duolingo. Then there is <a href=\"https://www.memrise.com/home/\">Memrise</a>, a flashcard app and community with tons of pre-made flashcard decks. Finally, there are some options that only cover a few languages, like <a href=\"https://iknow.jp/\">iKnow</a> for Japanese or <a href=\"https://www.pleco.com/\">Pleco</a>, a Mandarin-English dictionary app that has SRS flashcards built in.</p>\n<p>The advantage of Anki is its flexibility. It requires a bit more work for you, but that allows you to make the cards your own, the way you want them. Want to include example sentences? Go for it. Think images make it too easy? Take them out. Need to create separate decks for grammar and vocabulary? You can do that. Want to take a deck somebody else made and modify it? Anki makes it easy. Feel like the program is giving you too many or too few new words? Change it.</p>\n<p>I won&rsquo;t get into the technical details on how to use Anki, but <a href=\"https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html\">the manual</a> is helpful and well-written.</p>\n<h2>2. Review once a day</h2>\n<p>This is not as difficult as it seems. Your reviews will not take more than 20 minutes or so. If it starts to feel overwhelming, don&rsquo;t be afraid to reduce the number of new cards the software is giving you. Five words a day is not as good as 10, but you can still learn a lot at that rate. And you <em>will</em> actually learn over time.</p>\n<p>A perhaps strange tip on how to get the most out of the review: Make it about more than just processing information. Let&rsquo;s say the flashcard is a word you know fairly well. Try to get a feel for it. Imagine yourself saying this French word to a French person in France. Try out different ways of pronouncing or emphasizing it. Swirl it around in your head like a fine Bordeaux. If you don&rsquo;t know the word, think of a mnemonic that might help you remember it next time, or write out a sentence using it.</p>\n<h2>3. Make your own cards</h2>\n<p>Anki, Memrise, Tinycards, and other services have hundreds of pre-made flashcard decks for language learners. On Anki, for example, there is <a href=\"https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/593464734\"> 5000 Most Frequently Used Arabic Words w/ Audio</a>, <a href=\"https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2530965591\">Hangul (Korean Alphabet)</a>, and <a href=\"https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/159579487\">Tagalog for beginners</a>. It is tempting to grab one of these and start SRSing, but you should try not to do that.</p>\n<p>There are two reasons why. First, the act of making the card helps you remember the stuff on it. As you&rsquo;re making the card, think about the term you are adding, how you might use it, when it might be important, and so on.</p>\n<p>Second, the way you learn and the things you care about are unique to you. If you are studying Arabic in order to talk to your in-laws, many of the 5,000 most frequent words are probably less useful to you than some rarer ones, perhaps related to your profession or the area where they live. Making your cards ensures they are relevant to your world.</p>\n<p>Ideally, your cards will be based on things that have happened to you in your normal life. If you are an intermediate or advanced learner, you might add a new word you heard on a radio broadcast. If you&rsquo;re a beginner, you may have been curious to know how to talk about your interest in photography and looked up a few related terms. Or maybe your in-laws kept using a harsh-sounding word to describe you, though luckily it turned out to just mean &ldquo;tall,&rdquo; and you added it to your flashcard deck. The more you can think of the stuff on the flashcard as being part of real life, the easier it will be to learn, and the reason for learning it will be clearer.</p>\n<h2>4. Add context to your cards</h2>\n<p>Making your own cards means you have total control over them. And that means you can add any information that will help you remember what it says. Here are some examples of things you might add:</p>\n<ul><li>An example sentence, especially if you have the sentence you first spotted the word in</li>\n<li>Where you first came across the word&mdash;in class, in a book, from a friend?</li>\n<li>Audio of the word being pronounced</li>\n<li>A mnemonic you came up with to remember it</li>\n<li>The word&rsquo;s etymology</li>\n</ul><p>Most of this extra info should be added to the back of the card, where the answer is. The front prompt should always just be the word, or perhaps an example sentence, so long as it doesn&rsquo;t give away the answer.</p>\n<p>Doing this again helps you to think of the word in the real world. An example sentence gets you thinking about not just what it means, but how to <em>use</em> it. Thinking about where you first came across it reminds you that it exists outside of your spaced repetition app. The word&rsquo;s etymology shows that it is part of a system of language. The goal is to not just think of words&mdash;or grammar points, or whatever you&rsquo;re studying&mdash;as isolated bits of information. They are part of a living language.</p>\n<h2>Go forth and SRS</h2>\n<p>Learning a language can be frustrating. Progress often feels slow. Part of that is because there is a lot to learn. But part of it is also that language education often does not utilize the best methods out there.</p>\n<p>Spaced repetition alone is not enough. Don&rsquo;t expect to blast through 2,000 vocabulary words and be able to use them intelligibly. SRS is a tool for reinforcing the things that you know are important for your language learning, like words you come across often or grammatical structures that seem useful. It is no replacement for talking to people in the language you want to learn, writing practice, or reading words in the context of a story or article.</p>\n<p>But it makes the process of remembering those things much easier and more effective. You will not be studying words only to forget them later. You will not be reviewing words you already know well. The rules I outlined above came from my years becoming fluent in Mandarin in Taiwan, when I was constantly evaluating and re-evaluating learning methods. Two things I learned: Spaced repetition works, and that context makes it work even better.</p>\n<h2>Read more: <a href=\"https://qz.com/1213768/the-forgetting-curve-explains-why-humans-struggle-to-memorize/\">The &ldquo;forgetting curve&rdquo; explains why we struggle to memorize</a></h2>\n",

Despite the abundance of real and fictional guns in American culture, nearly 70% of US households don&rsquo;t own any gun at all, and most gun owners say new laws to make America safer could be passed without taking away their rights.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Far fewer Americans own guns than they did in the late 1970s, according to a <a href=\"https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/\">University of Chicago project</a> that&rsquo;s been grilling Americans about all aspects of their lives for over four decades.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"rkxFxDjvz\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_rkxFxDjvz.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The overall number of guns have increased, though, indicating that the minority of households that <i>do</i> own guns are buying more and more.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"rJ1IViEq\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_rJ1IViEq.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even before the massacre in Parkland, Florida, 60% of Americans <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2492\">supported stronger gun laws.</a> Most answered yes when asked whether greater gun control could be enacted without violating their right to bear arms&mdash;including most of those in gun-owning households.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"ByF9Mz0wf\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_ByF9Mz0wf.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">Since the Florida shooting, overall approval for stronger gun laws has risen slightly,<a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2521\"> to 66%.</a> The Parkland students have taken the issue head on, <a href=\"http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_31699782/boulder-chapter-moms-demand-numbers-grow.html\">gun safety groups</a> are seeing a big uptick in interest, and conservative-leaning gun-owning groups, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vetsforgunreform?src=hash&amp;lang=en\">#VetsForGunReform</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.stripes.com/news/gun-control-group-enlists-petraeus-and-other-vets-to-help-curb-violence-1.414754\">Veterans Coalition for Common Sense</a> are calling for more restrictive gun laws.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1214787-3\"></div><p class=\"p1\">Popular demand for gun safety regulations has been thwarted by Congress, in the past. A year after the 1999 Columbine High School<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>shooting that killed 13, 66% of people questioned in <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2000/04/19/a-year-after-columbine-public-looks-to-parents-more-than-schools-to-prevent-violence/\">a Pew Research poll</a> said gun control was more important than protecting gun owners&rsquo; rights; and <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/31/as-2014-brings-new-state-laws-a-look-at-public-opinion-on-the-issues/\">support jumped for gun control</a> after the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting that killed 26. Federal laws proposed after both massacres died in Congress.</p>\n<p>Overall, the majority of Americans support gun control. So why have their elected representatives refused to pass meaningful gun control legislation for over 20 years?</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">How the NRA spends its money</h2>\n<p>The NRA and its associated political action committees spent over $50 million on the 2016 election, as<a href=\"https://qz.com/1207851/parkland-shooting-the-nra-and-gun-lobby-invested-millions-in-trump-and-other-republicans-in-2016/\"> Quartz reported earlier</a>. That&rsquo;s just what the group has to report to the Federal Election Commission, however. A 2016 internal audit showed the group <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2017/11/audit-shows-nra-spending-surged-100-million-amidst-pro-trump-push-in-2016/\">spent a total $75 million</a> on legislative and public affairs in 2016.</p>\n<p>The amount of money the firearms industry (which is mostly represented by the NRA) reports for election spending is dwarfed by the overall reported lobbying spend from industries like health care, real estate, or oil and gas, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/industries.php?cycle=2016\">according to the Center for Responsive Politics</a>, a non-profit that tracks campaign finance.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"SJAE3lGOf\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_SJAE3lGOf.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p>But relative to the gun industry&rsquo;s size, it spends much more than other major industries: The pharmaceutical industry, which earned<a href=\"http://pharmaceuticalcommerce.com/latest-news/us-drug-2016-sales-450-billion-moderate-single-digit-growth/\"> an estimated $450 billion</a> in revenue in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=H04\">spent almost $43 million</a> in that year&rsquo;s election&mdash;including contributions from major drug manufacturers like Pfizer and AstraZeneca. The NRA spent millions of dollars more, but the US gun industry earned only an <a href=\"https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-trends/specialized-market-research-reports/consumer-goods-services/lifestyle-stores/gun-ammunition-stores.html\">estimated $9 billion</a> in revenue.<span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span><span>The NRA spends lobbying money with a laser-like focus. </span><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Unlike many other industry-focused lobby groups, the NRA spends with a laser-like focus, boosting pro-gun politicians who are almost always Republicans, and running attack ads on politicians support who gun control, usually Democrats. In fact, the NRA spent more than twice as much money, ($34.5 million) in 2016 on negative advertising against Democrats who might demand stronger gun laws than it did on positive advertising for Trump and other Republicans ($14.5 million).</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"Hk9SBEGvM\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_Hk9SBEGvM.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p>In the pharmaceutical industry, by comparison, almost $20 million of 2016&rsquo;s campaign spend went to Democrats, with the rest to Republicans&mdash;because companies are hoping to be in the good graces of whoever gets elected. Other industries that spend millions on campaigns to one political party, like, say, the oil and gas industry, are usually offset by donations from another field, like pro-environment groups. There are some gun control groups campaigning and lobbying, but they <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/totals.php?cycle=2018&amp;ind=Q12\">spent just $1.7 million</a> during the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Where all of the NRA&rsquo;s money comes from, exactly, remains opaque. As a 501(c)(4) non-profit <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/other-non-profits/social-welfare-organizations\">social welfare organization</a>, the NRA doesn&rsquo;t have to disclose its donors. Membership dues like those collected at the conservative convention last week make up <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/12/whom-does-the-nra-really-speak-for/266373/\">a portion of their funds</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nraringoffreedom.com/\">&ldquo;Ring of Freedom&rdquo; donors</a> like the <a href=\"https://www.nraringoffreedom.com/our-members/pete-brownell/\">Brownell</a> family, which owns Brownells, an Iowa firearms distributor, or the gun-making <a href=\"https://www.nraringoffreedom.com/our-members/ugo-and-monique-beretta/\">Beretta</a> family, are also big contributors. Then there are advertisers in the NRA&rsquo;s magazines, like Illinois gun company <a href=\"http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/saint-ar-15-pistol-5-56/\">Springfield Armory.</a></p>\n<p>Because its legislative arm, NRA ILA, regularly lobbies Congress, however, it does file quarterly lobbying reports with the <a href=\"http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/ldsearch.aspx\">House</a> and <a href=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=selectfields\">Senate</a> that show how much it is spending on politicians.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-1219454\" class=\"progressive-image inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium\"><picture style=\"padding-bottom: 55.660377358491%; background-image: url(https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-03-01-at-11-37-33-am.png?w=50);\"><img src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-03-01-at-11-37-33-am.png?w=50\" class=\"progressive-image-thumbnail\"><img data-srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-03-01-at-11-37-33-am.png?w=320 320w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-03-01-at-11-37-33-am.png?w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-03-01-at-11-37-33-am.png?w=940 940w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-03-01-at-11-37-33-am.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-03-01-at-11-37-33-am.png?w=3200 3200w\" data-src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-03-01-at-11-37-33-am.png?w=1166\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px\" class=\"progressive-image-large\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-01 at 11.37.33 AM\"></picture></figure><p>The impact of all this cash has been profound in recent decades. Presidents have tried to pass sweeping gun safety laws before&mdash;in March of 2000, Bill Clinton signed what was expected to become an industry-wide agreement with Smith and Wesson, but <a href=\"https://qz.com/1215914/parkland-florida-school-shooting-smith-and-wesson-was-a-leader-in-gun-safety-until-the-nra-stepped-in/\">thanks to NRA influence</a> it was unwound after George W. Bush was elected later that year.</p>\n<p>Months after the Sandy Hook shooting, Barack Obama&rsquo;s gun safety proposals failed to get enough votes in the Senate to clear the 60-vote threshold, despite polls showing 90% of the country supported universal background checks. &ldquo;It came down to politics&mdash;the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. [Congress members] worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment,&rdquo; Obama <a href=\"http://swampland.time.com/2013/04/17/president-obamas-speech-on-gun-control-bill-defeat-transcript/\">said in a speech afterward</a>. <span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;Is our democracy broken?

A little bit, it is,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When any organization spends tens of millions of dollars promoting the interests of gun corporations to influence what happens in our elections, then yes, our democracy is a little broken.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the last quarter of 2017 alone, the NRA spent over $900,000 lobbying members of Congress on 17 different bills, the group&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=E5008B6E-63BF-4E60-B94B-44AFDD457B88&amp;filingTypeID=78\">last Senate disclosure shows</a>.</p>\n<h2>Attack, attack, attack ads</h2>\n<p>In the runup to elections, the NRA has also masterfully attacked candidates who support any gun control at all, even if they consider themselves defenders of the Second Amendment.</p>\n<p>In the 2016 election, the only politician the NRA spent more on campaigning <em>against</em> than Hillary Clinton was Deborah <span class=\"il\">Ross</span>, the North Carolina candidate for senator. <span class=\"il\">Ross</span> hardly seems the election&rsquo;s most obvious target&mdash;a former civil rights lawyer who defended individual liberties for a career, and member of the state legislature for 10 years, she supports allowing &ldquo;concealed carry&rdquo; of guns to licensed owners. But as a state politician, she voted against allowing concealed carry in bars and restaurants where alcohol was served, earning her an &ldquo;F&rdquo; grade from the NRA, which ran ads that said &ldquo;Defend your freedom, defeat Deborah <span class=\"il\">Ross</span>.&rdquo;</p>\n<div class=\"inline-video\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\"><meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"North Carolina: Defend Freedom, Defeat Deborah Ross\"><meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Deborah Ross continually voted for gun control and against your right to self-defense.

Some conservatives &ldquo;want to join the consensus&rdquo; on common sense gun laws, he said, but &ldquo;you know the left is just going to keep coming and coming.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s actions in the coming days may test the organization&rsquo;s influence. He has <a href=\"https://qz.com/1217173/trump-wont-support-the-houses-nra-backed-concealed-carry-reciprocity-act/\">pledged to cross the NRA</a> on several issues, including raising the age for assault rifle purchases to 21 and strengthening background checks. After Trump&rsquo;s Oval Office meeting with NRA representatives on March 3, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee walked back some of Trump&rsquo;s promises, saying he supports stronger background checks, but not universal ones, and suggesting age limits for gun purchases might be easier to pass on a state level than a federal one.</p>\n<h2>Mobilizing its membership</h2>\n<p>Just as important as the money it spends on lobbying and ads, is the way the NRA energizes its base to urge politicians already in office to vote down gun safety legislation, and to pressure manufacturers not to agree to new safety measures.</p>\n<p>Members are urged to send letters, make calls, and sometimes march. A <a href=\"https://www.nraila.org/articles/20170929/your-help-is-urgently-needed-to-ensure-congress-acts-on-pro-gun-legislation\">September 2017 missive</a> from the legislative arm, for example, encourages members to tell House representatives to vote for the &ldquo;Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act,&rdquo; which allows gun owners to take their weapons across state lines. &ldquo;<span class=\"s1\">They have the money. But we have the numbers,&rdquo; it says, despite the fact that <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/365543-gun-owners-and-republicans-dont-really-want-concealed-carry\">polls</a> and spending data show the opposite is true. &ldquo;</span><span class=\"s1\">That&rsquo;s why no gun owner can afford to sit out this fight.&rdquo; The bill <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2017/h663\">passed the House</a> 231-198.<br></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The way the NRA activates its base strongly resembles the American Association of Retired Persons, the 38-million strong group for retired people, says Dan Cassino, a political science professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University, and the head of experimental research at <a href=\"http://view2.fdu.edu/publicmind/\">PublicMind</a>. Both organizations are effective influencers of sitting politicians, because Congress members rely on protests, town halls, and, and direct interaction to understand their constituents.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><del></del>Members of Congress &ldquo;have very little data and are incredibly risk adverse,&rdquo; Cassino said. &ldquo;When they get a lot of calls on an issue, that overrides&rdquo; everything else, he said.<span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span><span>After Smith and Wesson pledged to make guns safer, its CEO got death threats. </span><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">NRA members also been mobilized against companies. After Smith and Wesson made its agreement with President Clinton, NRA joined a boycott that tanked the company&rsquo;s sales, and resulted in it being sold off for a fraction of what its assets were worth. The CEO at the time got <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=DgXlZjWcKUUC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;dq=ED+shultz+death+threats+and+NRA&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0dzbp1_7Za&amp;sig=dbRY7YFQbcujchIsDj2RAFgOrz4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWvcaPhc7ZAhWNY98KHc6wDMEQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ED%20shultz%20death%20threats%20and%20NRA&amp;f=false\">anonymous death threats</a>.</p>\n<p>NRA members are strident supporters of the group.

They&rsquo;re also incredibly abundant.</p>\n<p>There are over 1,200 known species of tardigrades, which usually only a couple of millimeters large at most. Scientists discover about 20 new species per year. In a paper <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192210#sec001\">published</a> yesterday in PLOS One, researchers from Jagiellonian University in Poland identified the 168th species of tardigrade found to live in Japan alone. Scientists didn&rsquo;t have to travel far to discover the new species of tardigrades, which were found snuggled up in a mossy bed in a parking lot.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1219484-1\"></div><p>That&rsquo;s a pretty chill location for tardigrades, which can live essentially everywhere, but prefer to do so where there&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/tardigrade/index.html\">water and a bit of hard surface</a>. They can<b> </b>endure exceedingly severe environments: Scientists have documented instances of them <a href=\"https://qz.com/937683/scientists-have-discovered-how-water-bears-come-back-to-life-after-theyre-dried/\">vitrifying</a>, or converting their cells into glass-like structures instead of freezing, and returning to life after up to <a href=\"https://qz.com/620479/its-alive-scientists-revive-tiny-water-bears-frozen-for-over-30-years/\">30 years</a>. They be completely dehydrated, tolerate <a href=\"https://qz.com/909040/algae-and-cyanobacteria-survived-two-years-exposed-to-outer-space-on-the-international-space-station/\">outer space</a>, and deal with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/27576\">extreme pressures</a> (paywall) that exceed twice of what normally kill other kinds of life, including us. Scientists first found these critters in the late 18th century, but fossils of them date back to 500 million years ago.</p>\n<p>Finding new tardigrade species, therefore, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily involve searching far and wide&mdash;but looking more closely. In this case, Kazuharu Arakawa, an environmental scientist and co-author of the paper, noticed a patch of moss growing in the parking lot outside of his rented apartment and took a sample of it back to the lab. He and two of his colleagues used scanning electron microscopy and phase contrast light microscopy (essentially, super detailed microscopic imaging) and found a tardigrade unlike any they had seen before.</p>\n<p>Specifically, these tardigrades are unique in that they lay hard-shell eggs with bendy fibrous filaments on top, most likely to better adhere to surfaces. They also have an extra lump of flesh above one of their legs. An additional DNA analysis showed the team that these creatures are similar to species found in South America, but are otherwise completely unique.</p>\n<p>The more tardigrades scientists can study, the better: By understanding how these creatures can survive in extreme conditions, they can develop technologies based on them. For example, unlocking the secrets of tardigrade&rsquo;s biological antifreeze and dehydration survival skills could help develop easily distributable freeze-dried vaccines, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/new-species-of-tardigrade-discovered-in-japanese-parkin-1823393554\">as Gizmodo notes</a>. Isolating their <a href=\"https://qz.com/787509/how-water-bears-can-survive-massive-amounts-of-radiation/\">genetic ability to repair themselves</a> after exposure to radiation could one day help astronauts brave cosmic rays.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re intrigued by tardigrades, you can probably track some down yourself. Back in the year 2000, amateur tardigrade aficionado Mike Shaw <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/science/the-tardigrade-water-bear.html\">noticed</a> (paywall) that he could find water bears by scraping off lichen and bark from trees in the areas around his former New Jersey home. After leaving the sample in a petri dish with water, even a low-quality microscope should be able to illuminate some tiny indestructible beings.</p>\n",

    "ESSAY",
    "\n<p>I was born in India. What can I say about India that hasn&rsquo;t already been said about this big, beautiful country, where the culture and history run so deep that the people there have been killing each other for centuries and centuries? India is the most interesting, smelly, soulful melting pot of too many things and too many people I have ever seen. And the food is so good, the people so kind.</p>\n<p>But India failed women and India failed me.</p>\n<p>When I moved to the United States on a scholarship to go to Bard College in upstate New York in August 2009, I still had my high school hair (bangs) and my high school boyfriend. I did not know anything about AMERICA. When I arrived at JFK, I was alarmed and traumatized to learn that you had to &ldquo;rent&rdquo; the luggage carts for US$5. At the time, this converted to about 250 Indian rupees, and luggage carts were always free at Indian airports. How <span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span><span>But India failed women and India failed me.</span><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span></span>was I going to earn 250 rupees back for my parents? My parents had saved up for years so that my brother and I could pursue this life, and I couldn&rsquo;t even drag two suitcases around on my own. I felt guilty as well as poor.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1218598-1\"></div><p>When I arrived at Bard later that same week, I found myself confused about whether I was under-dressed or over-dressed. Hipsters were trending that year, and I looked around the campus and thought to myself, &ldquo;they must all be here on scholarship.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In my first class at Bard, First Year Seminar, or FYSEM, we talked about Hegel. I had not done any of the reading, because I had started to and then didn&rsquo;t understand a word of what Hegel was trying to say. All I could think, as my peers used big words to discuss and refute Hegel&rsquo;s ideas, was Hegel rhymes with Kegel. It was going to be a long four years.</p>\n<p>In the years following my not learning anything about Hegel in FYSEM, many things changed for me. I studied math and also became a convincing BS-er. Every semester I signed up for as many classes as I could fit in my schedule. I learned how to sit at a big round table and say things in a way that made it seem like I knew what I was talking about, and soon enough I was able to make a convincing argument about pretty much anything. I also learned how to drink irresponsibly and still live to experience the hangover the next day. In other words, I became college educated.</p>\n<p>What changed the most for me, though, was how I thought about my own country. I was about eight thousand miles away from my parents, from the house that they had moved to in Mumbai that had never felt like home. Every time I flew back in college&mdash;a total of three times&mdash;I started to feel more and more isolated from my country. I felt anxious when I flew in that direction, and relieved when I flew back. When I made it past the mean but mostly bored Customs and Border Protection employees at JFK, I breathed. I felt free.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1218598-2\"></div><p>The last time I flew back to India, almost six years ago now, I was a senior in college, about to graduate. When I stepped out of Mumbai&rsquo;s international airport, into the humid but cool &ldquo;winter&rdquo; air, my father did not recognize me. My mother would later joke but not joke that my father had pointed at every young woman walking out of the arrivals area, except me, and enthusiastically exclaimed, &ldquo;there she is!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When I sat in my parents&rsquo; shiny new Honda that they were so proud of, they asked me about my flight, and then asked me if I was ready to get married. They were joking, but I told them no, I was not.</p>\n<p>Then what was my plan? they wanted to know. I was about to graduate from college, what was next? How was I going to survive? I&rsquo;ll be fine, I said, you watch. I didn&rsquo;t know that I was going to be fine, but found myself saying so in a small voice anyway. They relented, I relented.</p>\n<p>I looked out of the window, onto the familiar streets of the city I was born in, a city I once loved.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1218598-3\"></div><p>I spent much of that winter break in my parents&rsquo; apartment, in the bedroom that was only mine when I was there. I volunteered with Teach for India during the day, but spent the evenings in my room. My parents didn&rsquo;t allow me to leave the house alone after dark, because India was not safe for women, and I didn&rsquo;t know my way around the city. Sexual assault and violence against women was a well-known fact in India, and it was about to become a world-famous fact too.<span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span><span>I wondered what it would be like if I ended up having to move back.</span><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>I felt oppressed. Not by my parents, but by the weight of being a female in a country that didn&rsquo;t know what to do with its women. I wondered what it would be like if I ended up having to move back. But if I had to, I would be able to do it, I told myself. India wasn&rsquo;t made for women, so what, I had to live, right?</p>\n<p>On Dec. 16, 2012, a girl who became known as Nirbhaya, meaning &ldquo;fearless,&rdquo; was gang-raped, tortured and beaten by six men on a bus in South Delhi. She was twenty-three years old, a physiotherapy intern, and was coming home from watching a movie with her friend on the night of her assault. I watched with the rest of the country, and soon enough the rest of the world, as the gruesome details of the incident unraveled. When Nirbhaya died a few days later in a hospital in Singapore, we were all stunned into silence, but only for a minute. Then there was anger, and grief, and protests. People took to the streets across the country and asked the bigger questions&mdash;how could we live in a place where the circumstances allowed something like this to happen? How could this happen? How could men do this to women?</p>\n<p>Then there were the anti-protesters, the ones who blame women, the ones who think nothing is wrong. That&rsquo;s a lot of people in India, and the world, unfortunately. I guess this is what happens when a country is shaken like this, we become polarized. But, at least we see each other.</p>\n<p>My departure day for the United States was fast approaching. I counted down the days, because my anguish had turned into sickness and anger. I hated India. Nibhaya&rsquo;s death represented something bigger, for me and the rest of the country. I grew up accepting that I would have to adjust my lifestyle around men, their advances, their violence. It happened every day in India. Women were brutally raped, assaulted and killed on a daily basis, sometimes in cities, many times in remote, isolated villages and towns. Those incidents, we would never find out about.</p>\n<p>The police and government participated and enabled. It was terrible, but no one wanted to become a statistic. So we went on.</p>\n<p>After Nirbhaya&rsquo;s death, there was a public outcry for change. And there was, in fact, some change. The maximum punishment for rape became the death penalty, instead of life imprisonment. The leaders acknowledged that the government and the police had failed. Some of the things we already knew were spoken out loud. This was hardly compensation, but it was something, a dialogue, at least. Finally.</p>\n<p>But, the issue with systemic oppression and cultural bias is that change is not enough. You have to un-do the damage already done. You have to look inwards, and ask the harder questions. What were the messages Bollywood had been teaching us for decades? What had our history taught us about men, and women? What were our own biases?</p>\n<p>Driving to the airport in Mumbai in January of 2013, I decided not to come back. I didn&rsquo;t know how I was going to do it. Immigration, especially for Indians in the US was an uphill journey. Every year thousands of Indians, and other immigrants returned to their home countries who did not want to return.</p>\n<p>But I was going to find a way. If not the United States, somewhere else. I could never again live in a country where, to some, to many, I was less than a human.</p>\n<p>My resolve to stay out of India ruined my psychological well-being for a few years, as these things go. I would not go back. But now, instead of being up against potentially violent Indian men, I was up against the United States Customs and Immigration Service and the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>After graduating from Bard later that year, I went on to work at a private boarding school in a small city in New England as a high school math teaching fellow. The program was a two-year fellowship, through which I earned a master&rsquo;s degree in Education from the University of Pennsylvania. My coworkers were smart and kind, my students bearable on most days, and the opportunity almost too good to be true. The school worked with me to extend my visa, and I was grateful, as this meant that I was not buying that one-way ticket to Mumbai. Yet.</p>\n<p>But I was unhappy. The truth was that I had accepted this job because it kept me out of India, not because I wanted to teach. When it came time to apply for jobs the fall of my second year, I applied for teaching jobs again, because this just made sense. On interviews, the people on the other end of the phone asked me why I wanted to teach. I told them about that time that student who hated math discovered that she loved math in my class, or how I enjoyed teaching my students about Graph Theory in a Geometry class, and how teaching math had taught me to look at math differently. I became pretty good at my &ldquo;why I want to teach&rdquo; speech.</p>\n<p>But I didn&rsquo;t want to teach. I just wanted to stay the hell out of India.</p>\n<p>I eventually accepted a job teaching high school math at a private school in Minneapolis. When I flew into Minneapolis for the interview, it was early February. I had never been that cold in my life, but looking around the city, the lakes, the tall, bundled-up people, I thought, &ldquo;sure. Why not?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The school in Minneapolis invested thousands of dollars into hiring lawyers who put my packet for the H-1B visa together. The H-1B is a work visa that American companies apply for every year to hire foreign talent. The applications go through a lottery, and every year 65,000 applications are accepted for review.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the year that my application was sent in, USCIS received 172,500 applications for the 65,000 slots. Mine, of course, didn&rsquo;t make it through the lottery. I suppose sometimes the universe steps in.</p>\n<p>The day I received the news, I went to my long block class in the afternoon and taught something about vectors, maybe.</p>\n<p>I had applied to graduate programs in computer science on the side, being the type of person who covers her bases. I was not a good candidate, since I hadn&rsquo;t studied computer science as an undergraduate. I had written a small program in Java for my senior math project at Bard, and knew a thing or two about web development. I wouldn&rsquo;t have accepted me.</p>\n<p>The only school I was accepted to in the end was the University of Southern California. It was the only way I would be able to stay in America, so I moved to California.</p>\n<p>The master&rsquo;s program at USC was my biggest failure to date. The program had been marketed toward people who didn&rsquo;t have a background in computer science&mdash;me. When I arrived on campus, I found myself surrounded by mostly Indian and Chinese people who had studied computer science or worked in technology for years. I knew why they were there; it was the same reason I was there. I passed my classes, but barely, even though I studied every day, all day. This had never happened to me before. A couple months into working for my boss John at my campus job, I quit, holding back tears of shame. I would have to drop out and go back to India. I had failed in my own mission. That fall, the only thing I looked forward to was the moment I could fall asleep every night.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the US Army had opened up a program enabling non-US citizens and non-permanent residents to naturalize through the Army.</p>\n<p>I joined the United States Army at 23, feeling that I was out of options. It was the toughest decision of my life, but I made it overnight, me on this side of the world, my family on the other side, all of us apprehensive, but somehow sure. I enlisted in the Army Reserves in November 2015. I dropped out of USC in December.</p>\n<p>A few months later, having completed basic training, I swore in as an American citizen in the uniform of my newly adopted country&rsquo;s army, in front of a couple thousand soldiers and civilians. I wondered what lay ahead of me. New struggles, probably. Better struggles, in my mind. Struggles I could handle.<span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span><span>I&rsquo;m an American now. But America has problems too.</span><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m an American now. But America has problems too. I worry for people of color, for women, for people in the LGBTQ community, for people who find themselves in the line of fire of a psychopath&rsquo;s gun on a Sunday night at a concert, or at a church, or at a club, or on the street. I worry for people who have been systemically oppressed, people who are up against forces greater than them. I know what this is like.</p>\n<p>But, if I need to leave my house at 3 in the morning to drive to drill 100 miles away, I do. When I am out late at night, I don&rsquo;t worry too much about coming home alone. I forget to text my mother sometimes that I am okay, but when I forget, she forgives me, because I live here, and not there.</p>\n<p>I have not returned to India since the winter of Nirbhaya&rsquo;s death. I will go back someday soon, so I can see my parents and my four-foot-11-inch-tall grandmother. But I will be coming back, to where I can breathe. Even if it&rsquo;s just LA&rsquo;s dry, dusty, smoggy air.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Learn how to </i><a href=\"http://qz.com/635686/the-complete-guide-to-writing-for-quartz-ideas/\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>write for Quartz Ideas</i></span></a><i>.

    "How much money do people need to be happy?",
    "MORE THAN ENOUGH",
    "\n<p>Take three people. All are unmarried, 33-year-old women who live in the United States. One makes an annual salary of $40,000, another makes $120,000, and the third makes $200,000. Who do you think is the happiest?</p>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0277-0\">recently released study</a> (paywall) in the burgeoning field of happiness research, the two higher-earning women are likely to report more satisfaction with their lives than the one who makes $40,000. But, perhaps surprisingly, the psychologists who conducted the study find that the one making $200,000 is probably no happier than the one making $120,000. This is because both the $120,000 and $200,000 women have incomes above $105,000, which according to their research is the point at which greater household income in the US is not associated with greater happiness. The technical term for this cutoff is the income &ldquo;satiation point.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The study is based on a life-satisfaction survey conducted on over 1 million people as part of the Gallup World Poll. Respondents across the world were asked to rate their lives on a scale of 0-10, where 0 is the &ldquo;worst possible life&rdquo; and 10 is the &ldquo;best possible life.&rdquo; (This author would give himself an eight.)</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1211957-1\"></div><p>The researchers analyzed the relationship between this score and household income. They find that in every region of the world, after accounting for a person&rsquo;s age, gender, and marital status, people with higher incomes are happier. But they also find that there is a level of income at which happiness no longer increases with more money. This varies by region, with Australia and New Zealand the highest and Latin America and the Caribbean the lowest. They even find some evidence that in certain places, when incomes rise above the cutoff level, life satisfaction gets lower.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows the &ldquo;satiation point&rdquo; for different areas of the world. The incomes are converted to US dollars and adjusted for variations in spending power across countries.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"HyKshEjwG\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_HyKshEjwG.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p>These psychologists, from Purdue University and the University of Virginia, are not the first to study how income relates to life satisfaction. In 2010, the Nobel prize-winning duo of economist Angus Deaton and psychologist Daniel Kahneman, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489\">famously found</a> that the satiation point for US households was about $75,000 (about $84,000 in 2016 dollars). This new research improves on Deaton and Kahneman&rsquo;s work, because the data is able to account for the number of people in a household, has more detailed income numbers, and includes responses from many more countries.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1211957-2\"></div><p>Dan Sacks is an economist at Indiana University who studies the relationship between income and subjective well-being. He tells Quartz over email that he finds the new research compelling, but far from definitive. The primary strength of this paper, Sacks says, is that the researchers have access to a huge dataset that, unlike many previous studies, includes a large number of high-income people. His main concern is that the research relies on flawed survey questions.</p>\n<p>The surveys rely on self-reported income, and previous research shows that just because people say they make a certain amount of money, it doesn&rsquo;t mean <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/srd/papers/pdf/sm97-05.pdf\">they actually do</a> (pdf). &ldquo;It could be true that on average, people who <em>say</em> they have income of $150,000 are no happier than people who say they have income of $100,000,&rdquo; writes Sacks. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not convinced that people who actually have income of $150,000 are no happier than people who have income of $100,000.&rdquo; Also, it&rsquo;s possible that rich people have a tendency to underemphasize their happiness compared with poorer people.</p>\n<p>People also tend to answer questions about their happiness differently on different days. While a person&rsquo;s answer on any given day is predictive of what they say a month later, it&rsquo;s not that statistically robust. Today, I say my life is an eight, but ask me tomorrow and it might be a seven. This measurement error makes it difficult for researchers to assess the income-happiness relationship with great accuracy.</p>\n<p>But let&rsquo;s assume that the research is right, and there is some point at which higher incomes don&rsquo;t predict greater happiness. Does that mean that if you already make $120,000, you wouldn&rsquo;t be happier with a $30,000 raise?</p>\n<p>Not at all. Research suggests that the <em>average</em> person who makes $150,000 is no happier than the average person who makes $120,000. But it could be that the sort of person who makes $120,000 is different in some fundamental way from the sort of person who makes $150,000. Perhaps, the people who make $150,000 would be less happy if they made $120,000, so their satiation point is higher than the sort of person who is happy with $120,000 and doesn&rsquo;t want for anything more.</p>\n",

    "Expropriating land without compensation is impossible—take it from Zimbabwe",
    "PAY UP",
    "\n<p>South Africa will now begin to reclaim land taken from black people near a century ago without payback to the current owners, dividing public sentiment along fears of a &ldquo;land grab&rdquo; and cries for justice. On Feb. 27, lawmakers <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2018-02-27-historic-vote-land-expropriation-without-compensation-passed\">overwhelmingly voted</a> in favor to amend the constitution to allow land expropriation without compensation.</p>\n<p>This is a marked shift in policy, and comes at a time when land reform (through both the State and market) has made more progress than experts and policy makers <a href=\"https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/opinion/2017-06-06-land-policies-try-to-solve-imaginary-issues-at-expense-of-real-problems/\">care to admit</a>. The African National Congress&rsquo; decision to back a motion by the more radical newcomers, the Economic Freedom Fighters also disregarded the facts about the stalled progress of existing land redistribution and restitution programs in post-apartheid South Africa. The decision comes after the ANC chose to formally adopt the policy at their December conference after a heated debate.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span><span>Someone somewhere within the economy will have to pay</span><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span></span>Ironically, South Africa&rsquo;s decision comes at a time when the Zimbabwean government has established a compensation committee under its land acquisition act to <a href=\"https://qz.com/1152276/zimbabwes-white-farmers-kicked-out-by-mugabe-will-be-compensated-by-mnangagwa/\">allow for dispossessed</a> white, former commercial farmers to be compensated for land seized 18 years ago. It also begs the question why the ANC and the EFF are taking a position that its revolutionary counterparts from across the Limpopo River are departing from. Nonetheless, if the Zimbabwean experience were not sufficient to proffer some fundamental lessons for South Africa, then it would be prudent to point out a number of facts that should call on policy makers to reconsider this new direction.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1218309-1\"></div><p>With the benefit of hindsight, the Zimbabwean experience tells us is that the notion of expropriation without compensation is a bad idea. Zimbabweans might have seized the land without compensation 18 years ago, but they collectively paid for it through eight consecutive years of economic decline that led to job losses, deindustrialization and a loss of agricultural export revenues. In 2009, economist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Cross\">Eddie Cross</a> estimated the cost of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s land reform at $20 billion&ndash;which included lost export revenues, food aid imports and economic growth foregone, which could&rsquo;ve sustained Zimbabwe&rsquo;s once promising economy, had it not seized farms without compensation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span><span>The South African government will soon discover the extremely complex technical headache of expropriating land without compensation.</span><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span></span>After unemployment rates of over 90% and tepid growth in recent years, the Zimbabwean government is <a href=\"https://qz.com/240908/zimbabwe-is-looking-to-end-its-isolation-by-compensating-evicted-white-farmers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">going back to correct</a> the fundamental mistake it made nearly two decades ago &ndash; which is to compensate farmers, whose estimated compensation costs are set to amount to $11 billion. The moral of the story is if the government declines to directly compensate its commercial sector for land improvements, at the very least, then someone else will have to pay for it, indirectly. The compensation effect, as we would like to call it, will see the <a href=\"https://qz.com/865978/the-40-year-failure-to-fix-zimbabwes-land-reform-and-prevent-rural-hunger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">entire economy and its citizenry paying</a> for land seizures through lost agriculture export revenues, job opportunities and more.</p>\n<p>In the South African scenario, there are two immediate points that are worth noting: the difficulty in implementing expropriation without compensation, and the implications of the policy. Firstly, if the constitution is amended accordingly to allow for land to be expropriated without compensation, how would the law cater for the assets on the farm and improvements made on the land?</p>\n<p>The land on its own is roughly 10% of the total value of a typical farm operation, if fixed and moveable assets are taken into account. Would sunk investments that make up the rest of the 90%, like general farm infrastructure, machinery and and other investments, be subject to expropriation without compensation too? If compensation is due for farm assets, and not the land itself, then the technical argument that arises is: Would it be prudent for government to pay 90% in compensating farmers for improvements to the land, in order to obtain the 10% that represents the actual land value?</p>\n<figure id=\"image-1218422\" class=\"progressive-image inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium\"><picture style=\"padding-bottom: 70.654296875%; background-image: url(https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtraba1.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=50);\"><img src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtraba1.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=50\" class=\"progressive-image-thumbnail\"><img data-srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtraba1.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320 320w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtraba1.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtraba1.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=940 940w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtraba1.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtraba1.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=3200 3200w\" data-src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtraba1.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=2048\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px\" class=\"progressive-image-large\" alt=\"Zimbabwean farmer Ian Cochrane from the Karoi district 200 km's north\nwest of Harare looks at burnt hay bales on his Renrock Estates farm\nSeptember 12, 2002.

Farm debt emanating from title deeds to secure loans already stands at over $13.7 billion (160 billion rand), bringing into question how the government will handle indebted land. If farmers aren&rsquo;t compensated, will the state repay to banks who are de facto partial owners of that land through debt? If government exonerates itself from compensating the banks, this would translate to $13.7 billion wiped off the banks&rsquo; books.</p>\n<p>If government commits to cover this debt, it contradicts the policy, becoming instead expropriation with compensation&mdash;except that the money goes to the bank not the farmer. Let us assume that the government is sensible enough to compensate the commercial farmer for improvements made to land as well as the bank through debt owed by the farmers.</p>\n<p>If it happens that the government determines the value of infrastructure and investments on the farms, and then uses that same value to cover the debt that is owed to the banks, then there are situations that could arise where farmers receive &ldquo;zero compensation&rdquo;. There might also be situations where seized farms are insolvent, in which case, the government would have to pay the banks the balance of what is owed by the farmers whose land they are seizing. This scenario is already permissible under the current constitution and does not require an amendment of any law.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1218309-2\"></div><p>The South African government will soon discover the extremely complex technical headache of expropriating land without compensation. By then, land reform may have stalled altogether. This could lead to further public impatience, placated by the kind reforms that could allow the government to seize land with impunity.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"HyCi-p5kz\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_HyCi-p5kz.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p>We saw this in Zimbabwe when commercial farmers took the Zimbabwean government to court over land seizures. The courts were inundated with litigations that would&rsquo;ve taken the government an entire generation to resolve. Then, in another moment of madness in 2003, the constitution was amended to nullify all those cases brought to the courts by commercial farmers. In that instance, the Zimbabwean government wanted to get rid of the headaches that emerged from land seizures, but wiped off $10 billion in land value.</p>\n<p>With the benefit of the Zimbabwean experience, most of which people are quick to ignore and dismiss, we learn an important lesson that needs to be the hallmark of land reform thinking in South Africa. This lesson is that there is no such thing as expropriation without compensation in a quasi-capitalist economy. The history of land expropriation under apartheid has left a painful wound in South African society, which indeed ought to be corrected. However, the enduring principle of equitable and just (not necessarily market value) compensation in contemporary economics serves as an important reference point.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1218309-3\"></div><p>If the South African government seizes private property for free, someone somewhere within the economy will have to pay, whether directly through loss in current and future on farm job opportunities as well as export revenues, or through protracted economic decline that will erode the purchasing power of money, losses in pensions and savings, and deindustrialisation that will destroy future economic growth and off-farm job opportunities for the current generation.</p>\n<p><em><i>Professor Johann Kirsten and Wandile Sihlobo are South African agricultural economists.</i></em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://qz.com/newsletters/africa-weekly-brief/\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief</a> &mdash; the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.</em></p>\n",

Many make the first, but very few make the second.</p>\n<p id=\"73e8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Both of these shifts require a great deal of mental stretching from conventional and societal ways of thinking. In many ways, these shifts require you to unlearn the negative and sabotaging programming from your youth, public education, and even adulthood.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1213777-1\"></div><p id=\"d003\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The foundation of the first shift is the sublime power of choice and individual responsibility. Once a you make this shift, you are empowered to pull yourself from poverty of time, finances, and relationships. In other words, the first shift allows you to create a happy and prosperous life, where, for the most part, you control how and on what you invest your time.</p>\n<p id=\"c4fd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Unfortunately, the results of the first shift can be overly-satisfying on one hand or paralyzing on the other. Thus, few people ascend to the second shift. Hence, Greg McKeown, bestselling author of <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382?tag=quartz07-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Essentialism </em></a>explains,<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&ldquo;Success can become a catalyst for failure.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>\n<p id=\"8902\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, when a musician starts out, they write lots of music for the love of it. Their dreams are often huge. If they end up becoming successful, in almost every case, they&rsquo;ll begin producing less and less music overtime. This happens for one of two reasons:</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\"><li id=\"716d\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Their focus shifts from <em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">why</em> they&rsquo;re writing music to <em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">what </em>their music has brought them. Consequently, they are either satisfied with their results and no longer have the drive to write more. Or, they desire to make more music but the fire (their &ldquo;why&rdquo;) is gone, and thus, they can&rsquo;t create the same depth and quality they once did.</li>\n<li id=\"7cb4\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They become perfectionist and paralyzed. They fear their best work is behind them. Elizabeth Gilbert describes her paralysis in her beautiful <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_success_failure_and_the_drive_to_keep_creating\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">TED talk</a>. After the mega-success of <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Pray-Love-Everything-Indonesia/dp/0143038419?tag=quartz07-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">Eat, Pray, Love</em></a>,<em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\"> </em>Gilbert couldn&rsquo;t get herself to write. She knew she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to replicate the results of <em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">Eat, Pray, Love</em>. This paralysis is where many, many people get stuck.</li>\n</ol><div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1213777-2\"></div><p id=\"b7e4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">However, Gilbert is different from most, because, as she explains in her TED talk, she continued forward in spite of her success. In order to do so, she forced herself to fail a few times&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;just to &ldquo;get it out of her system.&rdquo; Once she did this, her emotional blocks were gone and she was able to continue her creative career.</p>\n<p id=\"fed4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The foundation of the second shift is transcending your own independence, wherein your thinking stretches far beyond yourself. Thus, the second shift begins with 10x thinking and subsequently requires you build a team/network that brings your ideas into physical form.</p>\n<p id=\"0afb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In this article, I explain the process of experiencing the first and second shift.</p>\n<p id=\"4ffb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let&rsquo;s begin:</p>\n<h2 id=\"6e85\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Shift 1: The power of choice</h2>\n<p id=\"c9bb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The following are the core components of your mental model after you&rsquo;ve experienced the first shift:</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1213777-3\"></div><h3 id=\"4703\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">You are responsible</h3>\n<p id=\"c07a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&ldquo;If it is to be, it is up to me.&rdquo;</em></strong>&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;William H. Johnsen, famed African-American painter</p>\n<p id=\"2059\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In order to make the first shift, you must go from an external locus of control to an <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1991-97206-008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">internal locus of control</a>. This is the scientific way of saying: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">you stop playing the victim to external circumstances and take responsibility for your life</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"46a7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You are responsible for how you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">respond</em> to life. No longer do you impulsively <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">react</em>. No longer do you blame others for any lack on your part.</p>\n<p id=\"601b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You are 100% responsible for your marriage, for example. None of this 50/50 business. It&rsquo;s all on you. If it fails, it was your fault. You made choices and now there are consequences. Of course others may be involved, but you can&rsquo;t blame them for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">your</em> choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b7e2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the book, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs-ebook/dp/B00VE4Y0Z2?tag=quartz07-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win</em></a>, authors Jocko Willink and Leif Babin explain this level of responsibility as fundamental to true leadership. Hence, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">there are no bad teams, only bad leaders.</em></strong><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> </em>Any negative outcomes of a team operation fall square on the leader.Any positive outcomes, conversely, are awarded primarily to the team.</p>\n<p id=\"659b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Self-leadership, similarly, involves the same level of responsibility. If something doesn&rsquo;t work out, who (or what) do you blame? If anything but yourself, you&rsquo;ll remain hostage to things outside your control.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cc47\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Every choice has a cost and consequence</h3>\n<p id=\"b541\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3\">&ldquo;Free-will&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>\n<p id=\"87c9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;free&rdquo; to act however you want, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">unless</em> you&rsquo;re willing to accept the consequences of those actions. As Stephen R. Covey explains,<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> &ldquo;We control our actions, but the consequences that flow from those actions are controlled by principles.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>\n<p id=\"f7cf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The only way to avoid negative consequences, then, is to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">understand the principles</em> governing natural consequences. Hence, highly successful people are continually learning and striving to better understand the world around them.</p>\n<p id=\"f333\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You can&rsquo;t be free to act if you don&rsquo;t understand the consequences of your behavior. Ignorance is not bliss, but bondage to negative consequences without understanding the source and reason for those consequences. Combine this ignorance with a victim mentality and you have a destructive cocktail.</p>\n<p id=\"65cc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Yet, once you realize that <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">every choice&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;</em>even small ones<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;</em>will yield an outcome, you can then decide which outcomes you want. No choice is free. Every choice is tied to an outcome. Thus, every choice has meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"f078\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The final consequence (and cost) of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">every choice </em>is TIME! You can&rsquo;t get your time back. Of course, you can course correct. You can learn from past mistakes. You can solve problems. But there is always a cost. Once you realize that, you&rsquo;re far more sensitive about spending time on non-essential activities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"d327\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Success (and happiness) is a choice</h3>\n<p id=\"2b6b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Success, health, and happiness are all <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">consequences. </em>They are byproducts.</p>\n<p id=\"2f13\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">They are <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">effects, </em>not causes.</p>\n<p id=\"e9e9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You can&rsquo;t control the effects; principles control these. However, you can control the causes of these things, which are your behaviors. Negative environmental factors? Change them.</p>\n<p id=\"7374\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gillian_Yeo/publication/264479041_A_Meta-Analytic_Investigation_of_the_Within-Person_Self-Efficacy_Domain_Is_Self-Efficacy_a_Product_of_Past_Performance_or_a_Driver_of_Future_Performance/links/54b66dcd0cf24eb34f6d1a8d.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">A recent meta-analysis</a> shows that most people misunderstand confidence. Confidence doesn&rsquo;t lead to high performance. Rather, confidence is a byproduct of previous performance.</p>\n<p id=\"ab52\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, if you start your day well, you&rsquo;re likely to have confidence throughout the rest of your day. If you start poorly, that prior performance will sap your confidence, even subconsciously.</p>\n<p id=\"fe22\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Get this clear: <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">confidence is a direct reflection of past performance</em></strong>. Hence, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/why-living-presently-could-ruin-your-entire-life-1f6298420800#.y5y3eyyfo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">yesterday is more important than today</a>. Luckily, today is tomorrow&rsquo;s yesterday. So, even if your confidence today isn&rsquo;t optimal, your confidence tomorrow is still within your control.</p>\n<p id=\"6b29\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Once you&rsquo;ve made the first mental shift, you know that your emotional state is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">your own responsibility </em>and the product of your choices<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">. </em>If you want to be confident, that&rsquo;s up to you. If you want to be happy, that&rsquo;s up to you. If you want to be successful, that&rsquo;s up to you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2cac\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Momentum is essential</h3>\n<p id=\"8114\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&ldquo;When you experience positive momentum, you&rsquo;ll never want it to stop.&rdquo;&#8202;</em></strong>&mdash;&#8202;Dan Sullivan, founder of Strategic Coach</p>\n<p id=\"f377\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Finally, people who have experienced this first mental shift <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">really care </em>about momentum. They&rsquo;ve worked hard to develop their momentum and know what it feels like to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not have</em> momentum.</p>\n<p id=\"4539\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Being without momentum is rough. It&rsquo;s how most people live their lives. And without momentum, results are minimal, even with lots of effort.</p>\n<p id=\"5ed7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Consistency is key to developing momentum. You get it by putting intentional effort toward a singular goal or vision, and eventually the compound effect takes over. It&rsquo;s as though several outside sources are working for your good. Because, they are.</p>\n<p id=\"a3c7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Keeping momentum once you have it, then, becomes <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">very important. </em>Hence, you must maintain a thirst for continual learning and growth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"c23b\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Most people get stuck at the first shift</h3>\n<p id=\"17fc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">If you take complete responsibility for your life and choices, you will develop a love for learning. You&rsquo;ll come to understand and live principles which will organically facilitate success in your life.</p>\n<p id=\"6b26\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, there&rsquo;s a far higher level beyond this first shift, and most people never get there.</p>\n<p id=\"f1e9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the book, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tribal-Leadership-Leveraging-Thriving-Organization/dp/0061251321?tag=quartz07-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tribal Leadership</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">, </em>authors Dave Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright explain the different cultures of organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"711f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Most organizations operate in a &ldquo;Stage 3&rdquo; culture, where everyone is &ldquo;out for themselves.&rdquo; Thus, the goal of Stage 3 cultures is competition rather than collaboration. Yet, this competition actually occurs with the other people <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">within </em>the same organization. Everyone is trying to &ldquo;get up the ladder.&rdquo;Hence, there is sucking up, backstabbing, secrecy, and other nonsense.</p>\n<p id=\"5a9f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">People within these cultures don&rsquo;t care about the organization as a whole. They only care about what the organization can do <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">for them. </em>They also only engage in relationships so far as those relationships <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">benefit them. </em>It&rsquo;s all about them. And for this reason, they suffer. They can&rsquo;t think beyond their own needs and wishes. Thus, their vision for themselves and the world is actually quite small and limited.</p>\n<p id=\"2efd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The primary stumbling blocks for successful people who have made the first shift are as follows:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\"><li id=\"987c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">It&rsquo;s all about &ldquo;them&rdquo;</li>\n<li id=\"42d4\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Their vision doesn&rsquo;t extend beyond their own needs and goals</li>\n<li id=\"c71a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They become satisfied with and distracted by their success</li>\n<li id=\"200e\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They stop doing the very things that created their success (i.e., they stop learning and working)</li>\n<li id=\"36b6\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They forget their &ldquo;why&rdquo;</li>\n<li id=\"5bdb\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They become perfectionist, and lose their drive to fail and learn</li>\n<li id=\"4ac6\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They over-attach themselves to their success and perceived identity</li>\n<li id=\"326c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They go from offense to defense&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;rather than seeking more they focus their energy on maintaining what they&rsquo;ve acquired</li>\n<li id=\"1cc1\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They become obsessed with constant affirmation from themselves and others, and stop seeking genuine feedback</li>\n<li id=\"bde7\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They don&rsquo;t learn how to work well with others</li>\n<li id=\"c633\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They think their way is the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way</li>\n<li id=\"491d\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They can&rsquo;t trust other people enough to delegate or collaborate</li>\n</ul><p id=\"83f2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">If you are seeking a life of individual happiness and prosperity, you need read no further.</p>\n<p id=\"74fb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, if you want a much higher degree of growth, relationships, and contribution, here&rsquo;s how the second shift works:</p>\n<h2 id=\"ee30\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Shift 2: The power of context</h2>\n<p id=\"7ad4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&ldquo;Synergy is what happens when one plus one equals ten or a hundred or even a thousand!

You care more about learning than what other people think about you.</p>\n<p id=\"ba1f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Moreover, once you&rsquo;ve developed the confidence and skills to do incredible work via the first shift, you may realize you can only get so far by yourself. The &ldquo;lone ranger&rdquo; mentality is played-out and overrated.</p>\n<p id=\"c285\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You may be able to rock life by yourself. But you could rock life far more with the help of the right people. Naturally, this is the very ascent Stephen R. Covey explains in <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/0743269519?tag=quartz07-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">. </em>The first several habits are to help you experience the first mental shift, or what Covey calls the &ldquo;Private Victory.&rdquo;</p>\n<p id=\"c616\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The habits Covey outlines to experience this private victory are:</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\"><li id=\"b023\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Be proactive</li>\n<li id=\"c6b5\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Begin with the end in mind</li>\n<li id=\"1d3b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Put first things first</li>\n</ol><p id=\"08d4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Once you master these habits, you will go from dependence on others to a high state of independence&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;the first mental shift.</p>\n<p id=\"9b7c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, three additional habits of Covey&rsquo;s book are intended to take you beyond independence to a state of interdependence, where you experience synergistic relationships in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">all areas of your life. </em>What I&rsquo;m calling the second mental shift Covey calls &ldquo;Public Victory.&rdquo;</p>\n<p id=\"d34e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The habits Covey outlines to experience this public victory are:</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\"><li id=\"fe3a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Think win-win</li>\n<li id=\"62db\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Seek first to understand&hellip; then to be understood</li>\n<li id=\"0d4f\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Synergize</li>\n</ol><p id=\"e81d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">I know several &ldquo;successful&rdquo; people who do <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not </em>demonstrate these three habits.Rather than seeking to understand, they only seek to be understood. Rather than synergizing, they only do things &ldquo;their way,&rdquo; seeing others as inferior. They aren&rsquo;t team-players. They aren&rsquo;t teachable. They don&rsquo;t set up relationships that are mutually beneficial. Indeed, they care very little about other people.</p>\n<p id=\"e5e4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&rsquo;s been said that the 21st century is the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">time of the woman</strong>, because naturally, women demonstrate many of the characteristics needed to thrive in today&rsquo;s global and team-driven economy. On average, women are far better team players and collaborators. Men, on the other hand, are prone to ego and self-absorption. Men more often want the glory while women simply want to contribute and grow.</p>\n<p id=\"78b7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The following are the core components of your mental model after you&rsquo;ve experienced the second shift:</p>\n<h3 id=\"840e\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">10x thinking</h3>\n<p id=\"db8b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&ldquo;When 10x is your measuring stick, you immediately see how you can bypass what everyone else is doing.&rdquo;</em></strong>&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Dan Sullivan</p>\n<p id=\"bed0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Becoming &ldquo;successful&rdquo; requires taking personal responsibility for your life and choices. By nature, it&rsquo;s beyond average, since, to be average is to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not take responsibility.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Thinking 10x is much different, though, than simply taking responsibility. It involves a grand vision wherein others must also be responsible. Moreover, 10x thinking involves far more boldness and creativity than simply &ldquo;being proactive.&rdquo;</p>\n<p id=\"5009\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">10x thinking takes you from the goal of earning $100,000 a year to earning $1,000,000. Or, from helping 100 people to helping 1,000. Or, from getting 10,000 page views to getting 100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"e399\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you do this, your strategy <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">immediately shifts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"cb51\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In his book, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788?tag=quartz07-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tools of Titans</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">, </em>Tim Ferriss explains that 10x thinking can come from asking &ldquo;absurd&rdquo; questions, such as the question billionaire Peter Thiel asks himself: <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">If you have a 10-year plan of how to get [somewhere], you should ask: Why can&rsquo;t I do this in 6 months?</em></strong></p>\n<p id=\"ef76\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Of this type of questioning, Ferriss continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"5c2f\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\"><p>&ldquo;For purposes of illustration here, I might reword [Thiel&rsquo;s question] to: <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">&lsquo;What might you do to accomplish your 10-year goals in the next 6 months, if you had a gun against you head?&rsquo; </strong>Now, let&rsquo;s pause. Do I expect you to take 10 seconds to ponder this and then magically accomplish 10 years&rsquo; worth of dreams in the next few months? No, I don&rsquo;t. But I do expect that the question will productivity break your mind, like a butterfly shattering a chrysalis to emerge with new capabilities. The &lsquo;normal&rsquo; systems you have in place, the social rules you&rsquo;ve forced upon yourself, the standard frameworks&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;they don&rsquo;t work when asking a question like this. You are forced to shed artificial constraints, like shedding a skin, to realize that you had the ability to renegotiate your reality all along.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"3672\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">If you want to think bigger, ask better (and more absurd) questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b2d0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I once asked myself how I could write a blog post that would get one million social shares. The product was a 1<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/50-ways-happier-healthier-and-more-successful-people-live-on-their-own-terms-31ba8f482448\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">0,000 word list</a> unlike anything I&rsquo;d ever seen to that point.</p>\n<p id=\"d6df\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">These types of questions lead to creative breakthroughs and different avenues of thought. They also organically facilitate a very different strategic approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b79f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What absurd question will break you out of your limiting and traditional ways of thinking?</p>\n<h3 id=\"46b0\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Delegate</h3>\n<p id=\"aedd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&ldquo;Delegate everything but genius.&rdquo;</em></strong><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;</em>Dan Sullivan</p>\n<p id=\"bb22\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you begin thinking 10x, you realize you can&rsquo;t do it all on your own. You need to be far more <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">focused.</em></p>\n<p id=\"7fff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Thus, it becomes essential to build a team around you immediately. Your network is your net worth.</p>\n<p id=\"1d44\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The sooner you build a team around you, the faster, wider, and deeper will be your results. In almost every case, you won&rsquo;t feel ready to build this team.</p>\n<p id=\"b519\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Don&rsquo;t get caught-up with any preconceived notions of what &ldquo;building a team&rdquo; means. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you need to &ldquo;hire&rdquo; people in the traditional sense. It could mean that you exchange favors. It means you develop unique collaborations with people in other niches and make crazy connections other people haven&rsquo;t seen. The better the collaboration, the more &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; the goals you can pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"1877\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">These are mutually beneficial relationships wherein you focus on your superpower and have those around you who focus on theirs&rsquo;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9f56\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Collaboration and synergy in all areas of life</h3>\n<p id=\"203d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&ldquo;Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.&rdquo;&#8202;</em></strong><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&mdash;&#8202;</em>Helen Keller</p>\n<p id=\"39f5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Take a minute to examine your life.</p>\n<p id=\"08b8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you go to the gym, do you have a workout partner? <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://www.truefitness.com/blog/survey-reveals-people-prefer-working-out-alone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Surveys show that most people prefer working out alone</a>. However, if you&rsquo;ve experienced the growth available by pushing yourself with someone else, the idea of working out alone seems somewhat comical.</p>\n<p id=\"171e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As Michael Jordan explains, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&ldquo;Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championships.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>\n<p id=\"a913\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In a Darwinian sense, most people compete with others on their own level.Those seeking rapid growth compete with others who are far advanced, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Optimal-Performance/dp/0743277465?tag=quartz07-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">what Josh Waitzkin calls</a> &ldquo;investing in failure.&rdquo; An even higher order principle is collaborating with others who are far advanced of your current level.</p>\n<p id=\"ccb1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For instance, if you want to get stronger or faster really fast, exercise with people in far better shape. If you want to do incredible work, work with more talented people than you. If you want to become a better person, date or marry someone &ldquo;up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p id=\"c3f0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Of course, if it is a true collaboration, you&rsquo;ll need to bring much to the table yourself. This isn&rsquo;t about <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">social loafing</a>. It&rsquo;s about intensive growth, and must therefore, be both win-win and synergistic.</p>\n<p id=\"02b9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As Andrew Carnegie, among the richest Americans of all time, has explained,<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&ldquo;Teamwork appears most effective if each individual helps others to succeed, increasing the synergy of that team; ideally, every person will contribute different skills to increase the efficiency of the team and develop its unity.&rdquo; </em></strong>Another billionaire, Richard Branson, similarly stated, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&ldquo;Build your own business team. Survival in business requires a synergy of skills.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>\n<p id=\"2bec\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In everything you do, there should be collaborative and synergistic elements. Of course, there is work which is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">your work. </em>However, that work should be embedded within a group of others and toward something much bigger.</p>\n<p id=\"3ad5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Again, a huge difference from the first shift to the second is that <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">you are responsible for more than just yourself</em></strong>. Because others depend on you to show up and do what you do best, you are responsible to your team.</p>\n<p id=\"c9a5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">These others could be customers, fans, family, a workout partner. Whatever. The point is, you are responsible for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">other people&rsquo;s success. </em>Moreover, in many ways, their success <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">is your success. </em>Their growth and development is just as satisfying as your own&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;sometimes more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2d1e\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Rest and recovery</h3>\n<p id=\"9d1d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&ldquo;Working with a 10x goal and game-plan requires that your brain is relaxed, rested, and rejuvenated.&rdquo;</em></strong>&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Dan Sullivan</p>\n<p id=\"38af\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Deep, creative, and strategic thinking and work is exhausting. An essential component of the second shift is doing &ldquo;less, but better.&rdquo; Where the first shift is often about quantity of work, the second shift is all about quality.</p>\n<p id=\"007c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To experience the first shift, you often just need to throw a bunch of darts at a board. Simply throwing a dart is seen as a huge win, initially. Eventually, some of those darts start hitting the board and getting some attention. However, once you make the second shift, you are among the world-class. It&rsquo;s not just about hitting the board. It&rsquo;s about hitting the bulls-eye, consistently.</p>\n<p id=\"d317\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Precision.</p>\n<p id=\"0077\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Quality.</p>\n<p id=\"7999\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Conservation, rest, and recovery, then, becoming increasingly <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">essential</em>. This is true at all elite levels. For example, professional athletes spend an enormous time resting. <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/blog/playbook/tech/post/_/id/797/sleep-tracking-brings-new-info-to-athletes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Roger Federer and LeBron James have said they sleep an average of 12 hours per day</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"353f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Similarly, to build mass and strength, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://tim.blog/2007/04/29/from-geek-to-freak-how-i-gained-34-lbs-of-muscle-in-4-weeks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">many people need to workout <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">less</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">, </em>and give their body more time for recovery and sleep. Yet, during their workouts, they need to push themselves harder and heavier. Less, but better. The same is true of mental and strategic work.</p>\n<p id=\"5d49\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Recovery is more than just physically resting. It&rsquo;s also being completely unplugged from &ldquo;connection.&rdquo; For instance, a recent study found that constant smartphone use stops people from <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1359432X.2012.711013\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">properly recovering from work</a>(and life). In a sense, people are always &ldquo;on&rdquo; to distraction and connection. They never disconnect. People keep their smartphones on them constantly.</p>\n<p id=\"73cb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the study, the experimental group, who became more conscious of their smartphone use, and took adequate breaks from it, were able to experience psychological detachment from work (which is essential for recovery and engagement), relaxation, and mastery.</p>\n<p id=\"6139\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Take away: Set healthy boundaries on your smartphone and internet use. When possible, keep your smartphone away from your person. If it&rsquo;s in physical proximity, you will unconsciously use it. Keep it in your car when you get home from work. Or keep it in a drawer in a separate room. Allow yourself to actually rest and recovery so you can <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">engage in life and work! </em>This is absolutely essential if you want to truly make the second shift.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5c0b\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p id=\"e472\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">These mental shifts are incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"329c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Wherever you are on your own journey, you can intensify and deepen your understanding of the principles at these various levels.</p>\n<p id=\"2e84\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Never stop being a student. Never stop learning.</p>\n<p id=\"236a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Shatter whatever paradigm you have and get a new one.

    "The story behind the viral photo of a teacher in Ghana showing students Windows on a blackboard",
    "NO PC, NO PROBLEM",
    "\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">There has been global applause for a teacher in Ghana who posted photos of himself drawing on a blackboard with multi-colored chalk, the features of a Microsoft Word processing window. The students in his class can also be seen drawing it into their notebooks.</span></p>\n<p>Social media exploded in admiration and wonder at his effort to explain how computers work&mdash;without computers.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Richard Appiah Akoto, 33, is the information and communication technology (ICT) teacher at Betenase M/A Junior High School in the town of Sekyedomase, about two and half hours drive north of Ghana&rsquo;s second city, Kumasi. The school has no computers even though since 2011, 14 and 15-year-olds are expected to write and pass a national exam (without which students cannot progress to high school) with ICT being one of the subjects.</span></p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-1217879-1\"></div><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&ldquo;This is not my first time [of drawing] it.

His photo was seen as both a bit of ironic fun about life in Africa but also as a source of inspiration particularly for Africans in the tech community like the Cameroonian tech entrepreneur Rebecca Enonchong, who tweets as @africatechie.</p>\n<div class=\"fb-post\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hottish.owura/posts/1948212815208114?hc_location=ufi\" data-width=\"500\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The photos gained prominence </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TikyaKwadwo/photos/a.1511402802235705.1073741829.1250802124962442/1944963432212971/?type=3&amp;theater\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">after a popular Ghanaian comedian (who is also a teacher)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> shared it with his 140,000 Facebook fans and later picked up by international websites and tech enthusiasts on the continent.

    "Toxic relationship habits most people think are normal",
    "WHAT IS NORMAL?",
    "\n<p>There&rsquo;s no class in high school on how to not be a shitty boyfriend or girlfriend. Sure, they teach us the biology of sex, the legality of marriage, and maybe we read a few obscure love stories from the 19th century on how not to be.</p>\n<p>But when it comes down to actually handling the nitty-gritty of relationships, we&rsquo;re given no pointers &hellip; or worse, we&rsquo;re given advice columns in women&rsquo;s magazines.</p>\n<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s trial-and-error from the get-go. And if you&rsquo;re like most people, it&rsquo;s been mostly error.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-580940-1\"></div><p>But part of the problem is that many unhealthy relationship habits are baked into our culture. We worship romantic love &mdash; you know, that dizzying and irrational romantic love that somehow finds breaking china plates on the wall in a fit of tears somewhat endearing&mdash;and scoff at practicality or unconventional sexualities. Men and women are raised to objectify each other and to objectify their relationships. Thus, our partners are often seen as assets rather than someone to share mutual emotional support.</p>\n<p>A lot of the self-help literature out there isn&rsquo;t helpful either (no, men and women are <em>not</em>from different planets, you over-generalizing prick). And for most of us, mom and dad surely weren&rsquo;t the best examples either.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there&rsquo;s been a lot of psychological research into healthy and happy relationships the past few decades and there are some general principles that keep popping up consistently that most people are unaware of or don&rsquo;t follow. In fact, some of these principles actually go <em>against</em> what is traditionally considered &ldquo;romantic&rdquo; or normal in a relationship.</p>\n<p>Below are six of the most common tendencies in relationships that many couples think are healthy and normal, but are actually toxic and destroying everything you hold dear. Get the tissues ready.</p>\n<h2>1. The relationship scorecard</h2>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> The &ldquo;keeping score&rdquo; phenomenon is when someone you&rsquo;re dating continues to blame you for past mistakes you made in the relationship. If both people in the relationship do this it devolves into what I call &ldquo;the relationship scorecard,&rdquo; where it becomes a battle to see who has screwed up the most over the months or years, and therefore who owes the other one more.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-580940-2\"></div><p>You were an asshole at Cynthia&rsquo;s 28th birthday party back in 2010 and it has proceeded to ruin your life ever since. Why? Because there&rsquo;s not a week that goes by that you&rsquo;re not reminded of it. But that&rsquo;s OK, because that time you caught her sending flirtatious text messages to her co-worker immediately removes her right to get jealous, so it&rsquo;s kind of even, right?</p>\n<p>Wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s toxic:</strong> The relationship scorecard develops over time because one or both people in a relationship use past wrongdoings in order to try and justify current righteousness. This is a double-whammy of suckage. Not only are you deflecting the current issue itself, but you&rsquo;re ginning up guilt and bitterness from the past to manipulate your partner into feeling wrong in the present.</p>\n<p>If this goes on long enough, both partners eventually spend most of their energy trying to prove that they&rsquo;re less culpable than the other, rather than solving the current problem. People spend all of their time trying to be less wrong for each other instead of being more right for each other.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-580940-3\"></div><p><strong>What you should do instead:</strong> Deal with issues individually unless they are legitimately connected. If someone habitually cheats, then that&rsquo;s obviously a recurring problem. But the fact that she embarrassed you in 2010 and now she got sad and ignored you today in 2013 have nothing to do with each other, so don&rsquo;t bring it up.</p>\n<p>You must recognize that by choosing to be with your significant other, you are choosing to be with all of their prior actions and behaviors. If you don&rsquo;t accept those, then ultimately, you are not accepting them. If something bothered you that much a year ago, you should have dealt with it a year ago.</p>\n<h2>2. Dropping &ldquo;hints&rdquo; and other passive-aggression</h2>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Instead of stating a desire or thought overtly, your partner tries to nudge you in the right direction of figuring it out yourself. Instead of saying what&rsquo;s actually upsetting you, you find small and petty ways to piss your partner off so you&rsquo;ll then feel justified in complaining to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s toxic:</strong> Because it shows that you two are not comfortable communicating openly and clearly with one another. A person has no reason to be passive-aggressive if they feel safe expressing any anger or insecurity within the relationship. A person will never feel a need to drop &ldquo;hints&rdquo; if they feel like they won&rsquo;t be judged or criticized for it.</p>\n<p><strong>What you should do instead:</strong> State your feelings and desires openly. And make it clear that the other person is not necessarily responsible or obligated to them but that you&rsquo;d love to have their support. If they love you, they&rsquo;ll almost always be able to give it.</p>\n<h2>3. Holding the relationship hostage</h2>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> When one person has a simple criticism or complaint and blackmails the other person by threatening the commitment of the relationship as a whole. For instance, if someone feels like you&rsquo;ve been cold to them, instead of saying, &ldquo;I feel like you&rsquo;re being cold sometimes,&rdquo; they will say, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t date someone who is cold to me all of the time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s toxic:</strong> It&rsquo;s emotional blackmail and it creates <em>tons</em> of unnecessary drama. Every minor hiccup in the flow of the relationship results in a perceived commitment crisis. It&rsquo;s crucial for both people in a relationship to know that negative thoughts and feelings can be communicated safely to one another without it threatening the relationship itself. Otherwise people will suppress their true thoughts and feelings which leads to an environment of distrust and manipulation.</p>\n<p><strong>What you should do instead:</strong> It&rsquo;s fine to get upset at your partner or to not like something about them. That&rsquo;s called being a normal human being. But understand that committing to a person and always liking a person are not the same thing. One can be committed to someone and not like everything about them. One can be eternally devoted to someone yet actually be annoyed or angered by their partner at times. On the contrary, two partners who are capable of communicating feedback and criticism towards one another, only without judgment or blackmail, will strengthen their commitment to one another in the long-run.</p>\n<h2>4. Blaming your partner for your own emotions</h2>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re having a crappy day and your partner isn&rsquo;t exactly being super sympathetic or supportive at the moment. They&rsquo;ve been on the phone all day with some people from work. They got distracted when you hugged them. You want to lay around at home together and just watch a movie tonight, but they have plans to go out and see their friends.</p>\n<p>So you lash out at them for being so insensitive and callous toward you. You&rsquo;ve been having a shitty day and they have done nothing about it. Sure, you never asked, but they should just know to make you feel better. They should have gotten off the phone and ditched their plans based on <em>your</em> lousy emotional state.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s toxic:</strong> Blaming our partners for our emotions is a subtle form of selfishness, and a classic example of the poor maintenance of <a href=\"http://markmanson.net/boundaries\" target=\"_blank\">personal boundaries</a>. When you set a precedent that your partner is responsible for how you feel at all times (and vice-versa), you will develop codependent tendencies. Suddenly, they&rsquo;re not allowed to plan activities without checking with you first. All activities at home&mdash;even the mundane ones like reading books or watching TV&mdash;must be negotiated and compromised. When someone begins to get upset, all personal desires go out the window because it is now your responsibility to make one another feel better.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem of developing these codependent tendencies is that they breed resentment. Sure, if my girlfriend gets mad at me once because she&rsquo;s had a shitty day and is frustrated and needs attention, that&rsquo;s understandable. But if it becomes an expectation that my life revolves around her emotional well-being at all times, then I&rsquo;m soon going to become very bitter and even manipulative towards her feelings and desires.</p>\n<p><strong>What you should do instead:</strong> Take responsibility for your own emotions and expect your partner to be responsible for theirs. There&rsquo;s a subtle yet important difference between being supportive of your partner and <em>being obligated</em> to your partner. Any sacrifices should be made as an autonomous choice and not seen as an expectation. As soon as both people in a relationship become culpable for each other&rsquo;s moods and downswings, it gives them both incentives to hide their true feelings and manipulate one another.</p>\n<h2>5. Displays of &ldquo;loving&rdquo; jealousy</h2>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Getting pissed off when your partner talks, touches, calls, texts, hangs out, or sneezes in the general vicinity of another person and then you proceed to take that anger out on your partner and attempt to control their behavior. This often leads to insane behaviors such as hacking into your partner&rsquo;s email account, looking through their text messages while they&rsquo;re in the shower or even following them around town and showing up unannounced when they&rsquo;re not expecting you.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s toxic:</strong> It surprises me that some people describe this as some sort of display of affection. They figure that if their partner wasn&rsquo;t jealous, then that would somehow mean that they weren&rsquo;t loved by them.</p>\n<p>This is absolutely clownshit crazy to me. It&rsquo;s controlling and manipulative. It creates unnecessary drama and fighting. It transmits a message of a lack of trust in the other person. And to be honest, it&rsquo;s demeaning. If my girlfriend cannot trust me to be around other attractive women by myself, then it implies that she believes that I&rsquo;m either a) a liar, or b) incapable of controlling my impulses. In either case, that&rsquo;s a woman I do not want to be dating.</p>\n<p><strong>What you should do instead:</strong> Trust your partner. It&rsquo;s a radical idea, I know. Some jealousy is natural. But excessive jealousy and controlling behaviors towards your partner are signs of your own feelings of unworthiness and you should learn to deal with them and not force them onto those close to you. Because otherwise you are only going to eventually push that person away.</p>\n<h2>6. Buying the solutions to relationship problems</h2>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Any time a major conflict or issue comes up in the relationship, instead of solving it, one covers it up with the excitement and good feelings that come with buying something nice or going on a trip somewhere.</p>\n<p>My parents were experts at this one. And it got them real far: a big fat divorce and 15 years of hardly speaking to each other since. They have both since independently told me that this was the primary problem in their marriage: continuously covering up their real issues with superficial pleasures.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s toxic:</strong> Not only does it brush the real problem under the rug (where it will <em>always</em> re-emerge and even worse the next time), but it sets an unhealthy precedent within the relationship. This is not a gender-specific problem, but I will use the traditional gendered situation as an example. Let&rsquo;s imagine that whenever a woman gets angry at her boyfriend/husband, the man &ldquo;solves&rdquo; the issue by buying the woman something nice, or taking her to a nice restaurant or something. Not only does this give the woman unconscious incentive to find more reasons to be upset with the man, but it also gives the man absolutely no incentive to actually be accountable for the problems in the relationship. So what do you end up with? A checked-out husband who feels like an ATM, and an incessantly bitter woman who feels unheard.</p>\n<p><strong>What you should do instead:</strong> Actually, you know, deal with the problem. Trust was broken? Talk about what it will take to rebuild it. Someone feels ignored or unappreciated? Talk about ways to restore those feelings of appreciation. Communicate!</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with doing nice things for a significant other after a fight to show solidarity and to reaffirm commitment. But one should never use gifts or fancy things to <em>replace</em> dealing with the underlying emotional issues. Gifts and trips are called luxuries for a reason, you only get to appreciate them when everything else is already good. If you use them to cover up your problems, then you will find yourself with a much bigger problem down the line.</p>\n<p><em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"http://markmanson.net/6-toxic-habits\">MarkManson.net</a>.
